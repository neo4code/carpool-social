### Additional UI Components to Add
Using `npx shadcn add`:
- **Badge** - For feature highlights and labels
- **Dialog** - For modal-based authentication
- **Tabs** - For switching between login/signup modes

### Routing Strategy
1. **Public Route Structure**:
   - `/` - Landing page (unauthenticated users)
   - `/login` - Direct login page (optional, can be modal)
   - `/signup` - Direct signup page (optional, can be modal)

2. **Authenticated Route Structure** (existing):
   - `/` - Home dashboard (authenticated users)
   - `/page1`, `/page2`, `/settings` - Protected routes

### Integration Points
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Maintain existing Firebase Auth integration
   - Use existing `useAuth` hook from `auth-context.tsx`
   - Leverage existing `login-form.tsx` component logic
   - Preserve automatic user registration behavior

2. **State Management**:
   - Utilize existing `AuthProvider` context
   - Maintain current user state handling
   - Preserve existing loading states and error handling

3. **API Integration**:
   - No backend changes required
   - Existing auth middleware and user endpoints remain unchanged
   - Current `serverComm.ts` functions can be used as-is

### Content Strategy
Based on the product brief, the landing page should emphasize:
- **Primary messaging**: "The LinkedIn of Commuting"
- **Core features**: Route matching, social networking, income generation
- **Target audience**: Daily commuters, car owners, environmentally conscious users
- **Value propositions**: Cost savings, community building, environmental impact

### Implementation Phases
**Phase 1: Core Landing Page Structure**
- Create basic landing page layout with hero, features, and auth sections
- Update App.tsx routing for unauthenticated users
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Phase 2: Enhanced Authentication Experience**
- Enhance login-form component for landing page integration
- Add signup/login mode switching
- Implement modal-based authentication option

**Phase 3: Content and Polish**
- Add compelling copy and messaging
- Implement feature icons and illustrations
- Add animations and micro-interactions
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness

This landing page will serve as the primary conversion point for new users while maintaining the existing authenticated user experience and technical architecture.
